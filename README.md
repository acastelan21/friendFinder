# Friend Finder
This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Deployed Project 
The deployed project can be found at https://quiet-earth-32484.herokuapp.com/  

## What's Next? 
This is a functional project but next I would like to add CSS to make the UI a better experience. 

More records need to be added as there is only 1 person the record can be compared to at the moment. 

Validation is also going to be added.
